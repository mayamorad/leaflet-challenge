# Leaflet Earthquake Visualization Challenge

## Background
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) collects vast amounts of earthquake data daily but lacks a meaningful way to visualize this information. The goal of this project is to develop a tool using **Leaflet.js** to create an interactive earthquake data visualization. This tool will help educate the public and government agencies about seismic activity and its impact on the planet.

## Technologies Used
- **Leaflet.js** – For interactive mapping.
- **JavaScript** – Data handling and visualization logic.
- **D3.js** – Fetch and parse GeoJSON data.
- **HTML/CSS** – Structuring and styling the webpage.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/leaflet-challenge.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd leaflet-challenge/Leaflet-Part-1
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in a browser.

## Preview
The final visualization will resemble this:
